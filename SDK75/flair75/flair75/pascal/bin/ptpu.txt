	---------------

PTPU stands for parsetpu.

It has the same purpose and the same switches as parselib (plb) so please
look at plb.doc for information.

But there are some differences.	PTPU don't have the following switches:
	-c, -e, -i, -o, -p, -w, -z.

And the directory of the input file must have the following files:
	- System.idt from TP version same as input file;
	- turbo.tpl(tpp.tpl,tpw.tpl) from TP version same as input file
	  (or system.tpu in separate file);
	- all files used in the unit (if they doesn't exist PTPU
	  outputs error, but does not exit if possible).

The unit version may be found by the following table:

Header ID	Version		Comments
TPU0		4.0		(not supported by PTPU)
TPU5		5.0
TPU6		5.5
TPU9		6.0
TPUQ		7.0
DCU1		Delphi V1.0

ParseTPU can handle separate TPU or DCU files and one module from a TPL
or DSL library.
