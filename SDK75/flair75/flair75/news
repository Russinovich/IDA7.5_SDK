sigmake
-------

1.31	keep collisioned modules as unnamed modules
1.32	fixed bug with directory names in input files
1.33	don't keep collisions in startup signatures
1.34    maximum number of excluded names is 16000
1.35    negative offsets of public names are allowed
        small_func_threshold is 8 but it counts only
        defined bytes now
        better handling of collisions
1.36    -t switch works now
        better error message about missing "---" marker
        at the end of pat file

1.41    fixed bug with startup sigs: references by
        functions names are not allowed there
1.42    refer to the docs in the collisions message
1.43    added new processor codes to -hp help page
1.44    V7 signature files are created (standard zip lib)
1.45    global name have priority over local names
        if we have several of them on the same address
1.46    maximum number of excluded names is 64000
1.47    -r to not use fixup information
